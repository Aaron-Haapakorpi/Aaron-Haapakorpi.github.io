## Welcome to my project page!

This page contains various projects I have contributed in during my University studies. Of the code involved in the projects, only the code that I personally worked on is posted here, along with either gifs, demos or files explaining the project.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Aaron-Haapakorpi/Aaron-Haapakorpi.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
